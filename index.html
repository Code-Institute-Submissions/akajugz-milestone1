              Vegan Vitamin B12 is a must-have supplement for anyone following a
              vegan or plant-based lifestyle. Our super-convenient tablets make
              it easy for you to hit you recommended requirements of the
              essential vitamins B12 — especially vegans, as vitamin B12 is
              primarily found in meat, eggs, and dairy. Whilst some vegan
              products contain vitamin B12, such as fortified cereals and plant
              milks, many people still struggle to get enough of it in their
              diet.

              Clear Vegan Protein is our game-changing vegan protein shake.
              We’ve harnessed the power of high-quality pea protein isolate,
              infused with real fruit and added B vitamins, to create a light,
              tasty, fruity alternative to traditional protein shakes. And, it
              tastes great too, with 5 delicious flavours – Lemon and Lime,
              Pineapple and Grapefruit, Apple and Elderflower, Strawberry and
              Blackcurrant

              Our super-convenient, ready-to-drink Vegan Protein Shake is the
              ultimate plant-based pick-me-up. Each delicious serving contains a
              carefully chosen formula of almonds, pea protein, and real fruit
              or cocoa solids*. That means you get the perfect plant-based shake
              with 11g of protein but low in fat** and less than 175 calories a
              shake. And, if that wasn’t sweet enough, it’s naturally flavoured
              and sweetened with stevia — so you know they’re bursting with
              flavour.

              gooey caramel*, our Vegan Carb Crusher is indulgently delicious
              and perfect for crushing cravings. If that’s not sweet enough,
              there’s less than 2g of sugar in every bar. Yes, really.
