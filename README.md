Design: 

Colour Scheme -
The two colours that are prominent on this website are white and green. This is also displayed within the logo as well.

Typography -
The main font of the website is Poppins, regular 400 and semi-bold 600, throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as backup font if any issues occur. Poppins is easy to read and has various different styles to offer giving me a wide range of options to make the site as attractive and readable as possible. 

Imagery -
The main landing page image was taken from (https://www.biggreensmile.com/article/the-best-natural-supplements-for-winter.aspx) and the reason for choosing this particular image was that it combines the meaning behind the brand; the natural grain/nuts as supplements for your body.

Technologies Used

For this project I have used the two main languages used to create front end websites, HTML and CSS. Throughout the process I also used some bootstrap 4 to help me achieve the goals that I had in mind. HTML (https://html.com/) is the core language to implement content onto a website. CSS is core language that goes hand in hand with HTML to give the HTML content the desired style. Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework and it helped me style my HTML content exactly the way I wanted it to be styled.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
